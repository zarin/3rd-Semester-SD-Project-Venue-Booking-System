                 Venue booking system is a web application in which service providers or
                 a venue owner can registered their venues and customers can book venues for 
                 events as per their location, availability and interest.
                 A venue service or tune up is a service  
                 of maintenance procedures carried out at a set time 
                 interval or after the vehicle manufacturer in a service schedule and some
                modern cars display the due date for the next service electronically on 
                  the instrument panel. A tune-up should not be confused with engine tuning, 
                  which is the modifying of an engine to perform better than the original specification,
                   rather than using maintenance to keep the engine running as it should.

                 The completed services are usually recorded in a service book which is
                  rubber-stamped by the center upon completion of each service. A complete 
                  service history usually adds to the resale value of a vehicle.
                 
                 Experience service advisors in dealerships and independent shops recommend 
                 schedule intervals, which are often in between the ideal or extreme services schedule. 
                 They base it on the conditions and behaviour of the car owner or driver.
